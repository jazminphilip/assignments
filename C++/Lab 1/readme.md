## One thing you learned about implicit vs explicit conversion
I learned that combining different data types in calculations would implicity convert lower data types to the highest one, such as int to double. Explicit was done primarily by the static cast function. using a mix of both types of conversion was helpful in the assignments.

## One bug you fixed and how you found it
In my if else statement for checking whether the hours that a person has been working for was less than zero or not, I reassigned the datatype for my variables when I already did prior to the if else statement, which caused my code to not run. I found out after asking my friend that had taken java and also after looking at the 'buggy' code section of the lab.
